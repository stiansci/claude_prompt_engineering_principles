# Claude Prompt Engineering Principles

This repository provides a comprehensive, single-page guide to the core principles of prompt engineering for Anthropic's Claude models.

## Purpose of This Guide

The official Anthropic documentation and tutorials are excellent resources, but they are often code-heavy, demonstrating principles through Python SDK examples. While useful for implementation, this can be distracting when you're trying to grasp the core, high-level strategies for crafting effective prompts.

This repository aims to fill that gap. It focuses exclusively on the **theoretical guidelines** and **strategic principles** behind prompt engineering. The goal is to create a clean, easily scannable resource that you can use when brainstorming, writing, and refining your prompts, without the noise of implementation details.

## The Core Resource: `PRINCIPLES.md`

The central resource of this repository is the **[PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md)** file.

It consolidates all the key lessons into one document, organized by chapter. It's designed for both learning and quick reference.

*   **Chapter 1: Basic Prompt Structure**
*   **Chapter 2: Being Clear and Direct**
*   **Chapter 3: Assigning Roles**
